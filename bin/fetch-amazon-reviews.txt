This is a dark, grown up fantasy series.  Don't expect the typical story lines, and plot progression. I think a lot of people who call this &#34;difficult&#34; fantasy, however, are over-stating the reality.  This isn't &#34;difficult&#34; it just isn't obedient to the typical formulas fantasy readers have come to expect.Many have spoken about the fact that you don't know what is going on and have to &#34;figure it out&#34; as you go.  Sanderson fans will hate that - sorry - not meant to be an insult, but that is indicative of Sanderson's style.  His magic system is very direct and easy to understand.  This series is not.  This book doesn't answer all your questions, either.So, to be more precise, &#34;difficult&#34; is just too vague.  I would say this story develops suspense and makes you wonder about the politics, the motivations of the characters and the way the magic and world works without digressing to explain anything to you or to resolve all your questions. You must stick with the story to find out everything.  There are no 'informative digressions', which is a common feature in fantasy today.  What I mean by 'informative digression' is a point in the text where the main character or narrator will, as an aside, stop and 'catch you up' on how the world works, what his/her motivations are and just spend a page or so explaining things about the world and how things work in the world to you.So, this series has NO 'informative digressions'.Also, most modern fantasy is much more character focused.  These are all stylistic choices, not substantive choices.  It may make it harder to get into for some, but this is a point of preference, not quality.  Given, if you want or need those character driven stories or like to get filled in as you go, you won't like this series.Personally, I enjoy both kind of stories and don't view one style as inferior or another superior, but I accept the style for it's strengths and enjoy them when they are well done.  In this case, it is VERY well done and INTENSELY enjoyable!
This one was a ride. I really, really liked this book, and I think it was a hell of a start to a 10-book epic. And epic is most definitely the right word for it because man, there are a lot of moving pieces here. Erikson drops you onto the continent of Genabackis in the middle of an Imperial military campaign, and you essentially have to try to keep up. Many readers talk about how confusing this book is, and that it's something you just have to get through, but my advice is to not let that dissuade you. I think rather than expecting confusion, you should expect resolution and understanding to eventually come. Just trust Steven on this one, because although I now have only an inkling of the story, I trust that he knows what he's doing.Reading this book gave me a feeling of immersion and excitement that I haven't felt since I first read Dune (my favorite book) when I was around 13 years old. When I picked up Dune I was shocked to see a glossary at the back. A work of fiction so vast that it needs its own glossary? It was fantastic. I couldn't get enough of it; learning these new words and new places, experiencing this whole new world alongside the characters. Those same feelings came back to me as I read Gardens of the Moon, holding my fingers in the front and back of the book, flipping to and from maps and glossaries and character lists learning all that I could. I think I'm in for the long haul on this one.
Erikson dropped me into a world with a high learning curve. But I am so glad I stuck through. Something about the characters and the writing itself pulled me in and refused to let go. Until by the end I was incredibly invested and putting the book to the side after finishing with a whispered &#34;wow.&#34; Definitely worth it. I will be buying the rest of the series for sure.
I first purchased this book in 2011 and lost interest after about 100 pages. Too many names, races, plot lines, etc. to keep up with and the motivation just wasn't there to power through at the time. Well about 2 weeks ago I decided to try out Esslemonts &#34;Path to Ascendancy&#34; prequel and ended up finishing both books in that unfinished series in a little over a week and was motivated to give Gardens of the Moon another try. Really glad I did. Having a general understanding of the world and some background on a few of the main characters made Gardens of the Moon extremely enjoyable and I am officially hooked on the Malazan World.
I've both read this book many years ago and listened to the audiobook in the past week. Wonderfully written and compelling Gardens of the Moon comes alive in the mind.
This series is very complicated, and quite confusing at first.  If you don't have the patience to try and figure things out on your own from contextual clues over the course of several books, then this is not the series for you.  Nothing is spoon-fed.  BUT, if you do power through it, the payoff is a fantastically complex set of plots, characters and themes.Religious conflicts?  It's got it.Racial tensions?  It's got it.Economic savvy?  It's got it.Deep ideas?  It's got it.This series is one giant allegory for real life.  Keeping with that idea: we aren't spoon-fed how we handle life, nor should we be spoon-fed how to understand this series.  We figure that out on our own.If that hasn't sold you, I'll try one last thing:  Only Steven Erikson can turn a murdering rapist into a beloved character by the end of the series.
An incredible fantasy novel, like nothing ive ever read before and I've read them all. Gardens of The moon is easily my new favorite book. It is a must read for any fan of fantasy.
I have read the entire series, and the accompanying books by Ian Esselmont. Love the depth and breadth of the Malazan world, the complexities of the various plots and their intertwining, the mixture of mundane, magic, and technology. Totally engages the imagination.
Just a fantastic all around book! Great character development and a very engaging story. The romantic relationships tend to move a bit fast but not enough that it's too bothersome.
It took me a year off and on to get through this book.  It's written in such a complex world without explanation that it is tedious and more like studying than casual reading.  Too many characters, too many plot lines...I would read then grow tired of having to put so much effort in.  A year later I picked it up again and reread it.  The second time through it was far less complex and less confusing than I had originally found it.  So why 5 stars?  This book is an investment.  It's an investment of effort and time that opens up a series of books that are rich, complex, but increasingly easier to get through.  Stories and plot lines that are nearly unparalleled except in the very finest of the genre.  Books that are as gritty and raw as any of the so called graphic fantasy books.  Plot lines as well thought out as any in high fantasy.  Characters that are real and relatable.  Comparisons between Black Company and this series are obvious, but this world is far richer and well thought out.  The only fault I can say, is that the amazing amount of on world building was somewhat lost on character building (unlike the Black Company).  Altogether, think of this book as an investment to get lost into a wonderful series of books.  Although this book lacks a lot of the violence and grittiness of later books, it does a nice job of revealing a world with no distinct good or evil, just hope and anguish.
